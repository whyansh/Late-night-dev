I gave myself a challenge for I’d been avoiding work for way too long.

Even while studying and brushing up on topics, I just wasn’t feeling confident on my skill.

But what better way to learn than by doing? So I did.

In fact, this is the most complex project I’ve ever made. And not only that, I speedran it in just 3 hours. I had to finish it no matter what.

Guess what? It happened.

(Note to self: enjoy the game. you built it.)

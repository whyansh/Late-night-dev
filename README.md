As a challenge to myself since i have been avoiding work for a hugeee time.
even as I was studying the topics and brushing up things I was not feeling confident. 
what better way to learn than to do.
So i did, infact it is my first ever project of this complexity that I ever made and not only that, I speedran it, in 3hrs I had to make it anyhow.
guess what? It happened!
yay
enjoy the game (note to myself)
